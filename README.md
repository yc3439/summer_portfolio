# summer_portfolio

Welcome to my personal file repository, I will periodically push some interesting projects I work on and hope to spark any discussion.

keyword: python, R, Scikit-learn, Anomaly Detection, Predictive Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis

Most of these projects were related to machine learning. Some datasets were embedded within Python packages, some datasets were obtained from the public web. I hope to be more involved with the GibHub community by publishing my own work and explore others' repositories. 

Future work: in progress...
Problems: in progress...
